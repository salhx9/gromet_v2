# Gromet_v2

## Background:
 The purpose of this project is to quickly display my knowledge of python and postgresql. I created this small database example as an updated form of a project I had worked on in the past called Growth Metrics or GroMet for short. That project utilized a noSql database called FireBase. It was perfect for jump starting small project that was never going to be used in a large scale context. 
 
 In this new project, I wanted to redesign the schema based on using postgres. See design_decisons.md if you would like to know more about the schema. Or if you would like to run the code yourself, check out postgres_notes.md.
